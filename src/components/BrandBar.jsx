                                        Nothing is worse than failure. Jake
                                        Hunter, private investigator, was hired
                                        to find a missing girl twenty years ago.
                                        Jakeâ€™s failure to find the girl has
                                        haunted him ever since. Now here he is
                                        again on the case, and this time he has
                                        a brilliant partner, Kathy. They are on
                                        the hunt of a lifetime. They cant give
                                        up the search because giving up means
                                        death. The big question is, Can they
                                        unravel the mystery and still survive?
